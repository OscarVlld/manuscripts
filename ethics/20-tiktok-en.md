# TikTok: Xi Jinping's mighty remote control

Imagine a family watching television every night.
At first, there are only a handful of channels - 6 to be precise.
But suddenly, the audiovisual offer explodes, 
so that the family now spends their evenings flipping from one channel to another.
However, quickly, there are now thousands of channels 
so that most of the channels are never actually explored by the family.
To make the most of the audiovisual offer 
the family subscribes to a zapping service to better enjoy the whole offer.

Every half hour, the zapping service changes channel, 
to discover other programs.
At first, the family finds this service strange.
But little by little, they get used to it, 
and recognizes that the service is finally better 
to find innovative and entertaining programs
than the laborious effort of manual zapping.

Of course, it often happens that the family does not appreciate the proposed zapping,
but they can then change the channel they have selected themselves.
However, it is in fact even easier to ask the service
to zap to another channel instead.
Sometimes, the family can ask the service to zap itself.
However, the zapping service learns the family's preferences,
and its zapping is more and more in line with the family's preferences.
Therefore, little by little, the family is content to let the zapping service
decide what audiovisual content they consume.
And as this service improves, it also accelerates,
with a zapping every 5 minutes, 
and even for more and more users, zapping every 30 seconds.

Year after year, however, 
the family is swept along a slippery slope,
that leads them to consume content that is increasingly polarizing,
enraging and hateful towards other communities.
Exposed daily to the normalization of calls for violence,
the family itself has become radicalized, 
and finds the democracy in which they live no longer acceptable.
They want to silence the voices of minorities,
and the return of a powerful leader to restore order to society.
She even considers that those who still demand dialogue threaten your country,
and that power must be taken back from the corrupt authorities.
By vote. Or, if necessary, by force.

Moreover, increasingly, the example of Chinese authoritarianism,
where dissenting voices do not pollute the public space,
looks like an example for the family to follow.
After all, all the images the family sees 
represent a united, orderly and prosperous nation,
where parties are regularly held to celebrate the country.


## TikTok 101

As you might have guessed, 
the informational dystopia that introduced this video
is in fact an analogy with the services of the social network TikTok.
But then, let's quickly review TikTok.

Unless you've just arrived from a parallel universe,
you probably know that TikTok is a Chinese social network,
which has gained a lot of popularity recently.
TikTok relies mostly on short vertical videos,
often between 15 seconds and 1 minute,
although it is possible to upload longer videos.

It launched in 2016 in its Chinese version, where it is actually called Douyin,
but was then commercialized worldwide.
Incidentally, the connection between TIkTok and Douyin is quite strange.
While both platforms have the same interface
the contents of one cannot be accessed by the other, and vice versa.

On the other hand, Douyin is a much more complete application, 
since it allows, for example, to book hotels.
Finally, let's point out a potentially disturbing feature of Douyin:
the search for videos by face.
Yes, in other words, Douyin is able to find videos where an individual appears,
simply from a photo of that individual.
Or to put it another way, Douyin is building a database of images,
which can identify all those who have appeared in a Douyin content.
This will make it easy to find compromising content on many.
It's a bit scary...

Legally speaking, TikTok and Douyin belong to a company called ByteDance.
Amazingly, ByteDance is incorporated in the Cayman Islands -
apparently even the Chinese leaders like tax evasion
(oh sorry, I meant tax "optimization").
However, the head office is in Beijing, the Chinese capital.
ByteDance develops other products, including Toutiao,
a platform for personalized recommendations of news sites -
so I don't know who wrote the Toutiao Wikipedia page,
but the page insists a lot on the very sophisticated machine learning 
developed and deployed for this recommendation...

Today, TikTok is THE social network that is exploding in popularity, 
especially among young people.
In 2020, TikTok has exceeded 2 billion downloads on mobile.
And while the fraction of American teens using Facebook or Twitter has dropped
over the past half-decade,
TikTok has overtaken Instagram and Snapchat
to become the second most used social network, behind YouTube.  
https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2022/08/10/teens-social-media-and-technology-2022/
And it is even the most used among children.
https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/13/kids-and-teens-watch-more-tiktok-than-youtube-tiktok-91-minutes-in-2021-youtube-56/

And crucially so, 
far from the collective imagination that TikTok is all about dance videos,
TikTok is playing an increasingly central role in the dissemination of information.
According to a study by the Pew Research Institute, 
while the fraction of Twitter users 
who regularly follow news on Twitter is declining (same for Facebook, Reddit and YouTube)
TikTok users will increasingly learn about the world
directly via the TikTok app.  
https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/10/21/more-americans-are-getting-news-on-tiktok-bucking-the-trend-on-other-social-media-sites/

In other words, TikTok's remote control, 
previously used mostly to flick to entertainment channels,
seems to be used more and more for flipping to news channels.
And that should sound terrifying.
Especially since this TikTok zapper, 
that recommendation algorithm that chooses which video to play for which user,
is really much more powerful on TikTok,
than it is on platforms like YouTube, Facebook or Twitter.

Indeed, on TikTok, by default, there is no notion of video to click on.
The recommendation algorithm zaps and plays the next video,
without the user taking any action whatsoever.
TikTok's algorithm is overpowering.

And that should generate a lot of curiosity and attention for this algorithm.
How is it programmed?
What is its goal?
And who decides what that goal is?
Who has the power to harness the monumental power of TikTok's zapper?


## TikTok, controlled by Xi?

So ByteDance is a private company, 
and one would think that, as such, 
it is independent from the Chinese Communist Party.
At least, that's what TikTok claims.  
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-tiktok-us-idUSKBN1XF2N1

But of course, because of the lack of audits of TikTok's information infrastructure
the American authorities are not convinced by TikTok's statements.  
https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/tiktok-china-data-privacy-lawsuit-bytedance-a9230426.html

And when we know how much even companies from democratic countries lie,
including to scientists who accept their lies,
there is indeed reason to be dubious.  
https://tournesol.app/entities/yt:-UDLorjyWg0  
https://tournesol.app/entities/yt:IVqXKP91L4E

All the more so as the geopolitical stakes, to which we will return, are absolutely enormous.
To get a good idea of them, it is instructive to keep in mind a figure
shared and published by the Strategic Research Institute of the Military School in France:
20 million Chinese would be paid by the Chinese authorities 
to produce disinformation, including 2 million full-time.  
https://www.irsem.fr/report.html

Moreover, the case of Jack Ma, ex-CEO of Alibaba and 5th largest fortune in China
is particularly worrying.
This businessman, well known for his statements challenging
of China's one-party rule,
mysteriously disappeared from October 2020 to January 2021.
And strangely, he became less critical afterwards.  
https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2021/06/24/what-really-happened-to-jack-ma/  
https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56448688

The case of Jack Ma seems in fact representative of a greater attention given
by the Chinese government to Chinese digital companies.
And ByteDance, the company that develops TikTok, is no exception.
For example, in 2021, Zhang Yiming, 
CEO of ByteDance and the second richest man in China, 
resigns, at the age of only 38,
which seems rather... strange.  
https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/03/bytedance-founder-zhang-yiming-steps-down-as-chairman-amid-reshuffle.html  
https://edition.cnn.com/2021/05/20/tech/zhang-bytedance-ceo-resignation-intl-hnk/index.html

In April 2021, the Internet Investment Fund of China, 
a state-owned enterprise of the Cyberspace Administration of China,
took shares in ByteDance,
which allowed it to place a government official, Wu Shugang,
on ByteDance's board of directors.  
https://www.reuters.com/technology/bytedance-says-china-unit-holds-local-licences-response-media-report-2021-08-16/

Then in 2022, the Chinese government itself bought shares in ByteDance.  
https://gamerant.com/tiktok-chinese-government-acquires-bytedance-stake/

Finally, as a result of increasingly compromising elements,
In November 2022, TikTok finally admitted that staff in China
could indeed access European users' data - and the same is probably true of
and the same is likely true of U.S. user data.
That said, TikTok still insists that Xi Jinping's government does not have access to this data.  
https://fortune.com/2022/11/03/tiktok-china-staff-european-user-data-access-fcc-commissioner-urges-app-be-banned/  
https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/14/tech/tiktok-china-data/index.html


## Geopolitical issues

TikTok's recommendation algorithm is thus an overpowered remote control,
that the overpowered dictator Xi Jinping can reprogram as he pleases.
But how much would he want to change this algorithm?
What are the geopolitical stakes behind the control over the TikTok algorithm?
Well, I invited Jean-Lou Fourquet, 
journalist and content creator of the channel Après la Bière,
to come and talk to us about it.

> Uyghurs, Tibet, Hong Kong.

> Taiwan.

> Weakening democracies.

> Seducing Asian and African markets.

> Covering up climate change.

> Pretending that the zero-COVID is effective.

I take this opportunity to point out that 
that Jean-Lou previously had a column in "Arrêt sur Image", 
but that it was interrupted because, according to the producers, 
Jean-Lou had done the trick of recommendation algorithms.
As you may have understood by following me,
I consider that this subject is actually more important and complex 
than other equally important and complex subjects like climate change.
And therefore to affirm that we can "have done the trick",
it seems to me to be a serious error of judgment.
Imagine if someone told you "no, TF1 will stop talking about climate change,
because we have done the trick"...


## Remote controls, a Trojan horse

Too often for my taste, the attention is focused on the data extracted by TikTok.
And yes, in a way, TikTok is a formidable spyware, 
i.e. a software that allows surveillance, 
installed on the phones of billions of people around the world.
But if TikTok seems absolutely terrifying to me
it is much more because it is a remote control 
that controls the daily informational exposure of these billions of people.

What's more, this remote control is extremely opaque.
It is extremely difficult to understand how TikTok organizes the flow of information.
Does TikTok de-recommend news stories about Uyghurs, 
i.e., artificially decreasing their recommendations, also known as shadow-banning?
What about videos on climate change, 
for which China is increasingly responsible?  
https://tournesol.app/entities/yt:GBp_NgrrtPM

On the other hand, does TikTok amplify the calls to hate of extreme right-wing movements?
Does it give much more visibility to clashes and disinformation?
Today, it is impossible to provide quantitative answers to these questions.
And this opacity reinforces the power of nuisance of the Chinese authorities,
who can thus harm democracies without their interventions being identifiable.

Worse, controversies over moderation act as a strategic distraction,
a well-documented strategy of the Chinese government.  
https://tournesol.app/entities/yt:LdjPCMo8I2s  
In other words, moderation gets all the attention from the media, politicians and regulators,
so much so that new regulations like the European Union's Digital Services Act (or DSA)
include many restrictions and requirements for moderation,
but completely ignore the problem of recommendation,
as I could see when I was invited in a committee of experts of ARCOM,
the Authority for the Regulation of Audiovisual and Digital Communication.  
https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-services-act-ensuring-safe-and-accountable-online-environment_en

Unfortunately, as a consequence,
the auditing of recommendation algorithms is today seriously underfunded,
so much so that it is almost non-existent - even though we are talking about a national security issue!
Yet, the necessary means for adequate audits are enormous,
especially since TikTok's remote controls are ultra-personalized.
The recommendations made to a TikTok account are in fact very little representative of
recommendations made to other TikTok accounts,
who may be more prone to radicalization,
or more easily victims of strategic distraction -
I'm thinking in particular of AI researchers who are quicker to 
to marvel at gadgets that generate photorealistic images than to focus on the
than to focus on the dangers of recommendation algorithms.

In fact, the auditing problem is even more complex,
because the recommendations made by TikTok are not necessarily representative of
recommendations that TikTok will make in the years to come.
After all, TikTok is still in a phase of enormous growth.
In this context, the Chinese authorities have in fact every interest to persevere
in the quest for market share,
so that its remote control works on more phones around the world.
But to achieve this, TikTok has every interest in avoiding controversy,
such as questionable TikTok recommendations that would raise concerns.
So it's not surprising that, for the time being
TikTok's remote control is still primarily used to deliver entertaining content.

In fact, the main concern with TikTok should not be
the recommendations made today by the TikTok algorithm.
The main concern is more about the governance of this TikTok remote control.
Who, today and tomorrow, will have the power to reprogram this remote control?
To whom are we ceding the power to manage the flow of information around the world?

More than a frontal attack on democracy,
TikTok looks like a Trojan horse, a distracting offering
that could one day trigger the collapse of democracies.


## The problem of algorithmic governance

So, this video focuses on TikTok,
because it is a particularly striking example,
but the concerns we've raised actually apply 
for all of the world's most powerful remotes.
Who controls the remotes for YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn?
Who will control them tomorrow?
And who will control those who have control of these remotes?

As you probably know, Twitter was recently bought by Elon Musk,
a billionaire who has been quick to take actions that are of great concern to
anyone who cares about the quality of information,
cyber-harassment and the dangerous proliferation of hate speech.  
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/28/twitter-takeover-fears-raised-over-disinformation-and-hate-speech  
Twitter is also partly owned by funds linked to the Saudi Arabian monarchy
and partly to Qatar,
two countries known for their recurrent human rights abuses,
and has already had several employees charged with spying for that country.  
https://www.axios.com/2022/11/01/elon-musk-twitter-saudi-arabia  
https://www.arabianbusiness.com/industries/technology/saudis-prince-alwaleed-qatar-wealth-fund-meet-the-investors-who-funded-elon-musks-twitter-buyout  
https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-twitter-employee-found-guilty-acting-agent-foreign-government-and-unlawfully-sharing

Telegram, meanwhile, is headquartered in the United Arab Emirates, 
most likely involved in horrific massacres,
notably in Libya, Yemen and Ethiopia.
What's more, contrary to what is often announced,
Telegram is not encrypted, at least not by default.
And above all, Telegram is NOT open-source, and it is not free either.
Or at least, only the front-end, i.e. the application you download,
is open-source.
However, what Telegram does with your unencrypted data is completely opaque,
and relies on unknown proprietary software.  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(software)

Facebook seems to have followed the shareholders' demands for several years,
which has led them to prioritize, again and again, 
profits over the security of entire populations that are now victims of genocide,
notably in Myanmar, Tigray and India.  
https://tournesol.app/entities/yt:sAjm3-IaRtI

Moreover, the free code of Mastodon has been hijacked by Donald Trump,
who used it to create his social network Truth Social, 
a veritable nest of radicalization where, instead of Retweeting other people's messages,
you can "Retruth" them.  
https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22752850/mastodon-trump-truth-social-network-open-source-gab-legal-notice  
https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmashable.com%2Farticle%2Finside-truth-social-trump-social-network-tour  
And if the moderation on Mastodon has the advantage of being decentralized 
on different instances that can each apply their own rules,
the very design of Mastodon encourages filter bubbles,
and thus the emergence of nests of radicalization impossible to moderate, except by law.
In fact, this example shows that the challenge of moderation is not only to decentralize its governance, 
but it is also necessary that this governance applies to all users,
to avoid that those who refuse to hear about climate change 
or compassion towards vulnerable populations,
can become isolated, radicalized, and thus pose a threat to these vulnerable populations.

Finally, Google literally propelled Raoult via his remote control, 
which probably led to thousands of additional deaths of COVID,
but also and above all to a dangerous normalization of rejection by the authorities,
and a dangerous loss of confidence of public institutes and scientists.
What's more, Google fired its ethics team,  
https://tournesol.app/entities/yt:HbFadtOxs4k  
and misleads the scientific community by misinforming about the security of its algorithms,
all to speed up the much too hasty deployment 
of new and more personalized remote controls,
but also indirectly manipulated by troll campaigns.  
https://tournesol.app/entities/yt:IVqXKP91L4E

More generally, in the era of spyware, 
especially a priori deployed in the application of the COP 27 summit in Egypt,  
https://www.politico.eu/article/cop-27-climate-change-app-cybersecurity-weapon-risks/  
any major system of influence controlled by a handful of individuals
may in fact be under the control of malicious entities
who exploit threats or blackmail.
In fact, this concern goes beyond digital remotes,
since many heads of state seem to have been monitored in this way for years,
including Emmanuel Macron and Liz Truss, the former British Prime Minister.  
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-57907258  
https://nypost.com/2022/10/29/russian-agents-may-have-hacked-former-british-pm-liz-trusss-phone-report/

Therefore, national security seems to require decentralized, not unilateral, control
of any remote control of massive information flows through the web.
Or put another way, there is an urgent need for collaborative governance of the web.  
https://tournesol.app/entities/yt:hdAEGAwlK0M

Note that this is NOT what Mastodon proposes, 
which rather proposes to each one to create his own governance, 
but which can only be applied to all users who have agreed to join the
to join the governed structure.
In fact, more generally, governance is a different problem than ownership.
Even free software can be corrupted by unilateral governance.

But then, what exists today to collaboratively govern remote controls?
Well, as far as I know - and I've done a lot of spelunking of the scientific literature -
there is only one deployed project of advanced and secure collaborative governance
and that is the Tournesol project.
And well, I'm not going to rehash the pitch of what Tournesol is,
but I hope this video helps you better understand the need Tournesol addresses.
And if you too think that governing remotes collaboratively is critical
for national security and peace around the world,
I strongly encourage you to participate in our project,
by creating an account and comparing videos 
to collaboratively program the Tournesol remote.

Remote controls have become overpowered.
Tools like Tournesol seem to be indispensable to govern them collaboratively.


## Conclusion

I hope to have convinced you that, from now on and even more in the years to come
the TikTok remote control is a weapon of mass destruction,
in the information war between the world's superpowers,
perhaps more terrifying than climate change and Putin's nuclear threats.
In a terribly frustrating way, however,
the danger posed by this remote control is a huge #MuteNews.
Few people talk about TikTok as a danger,
and even fewer are focusing more on the recommendation algorithm
than on the extraction of personal data.

And again, in this video, we only talked about the risks of malicious use
of the TikTok remote control.
In practice, this maliciousness is not even necessary to harm the company.
TikTok is already having a dramatic impact on users' attention spans,  
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09311-w  
as well as on their mental health and productivity.
So much so that access to Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, is restricted in China.
For example, children under 14 are only allowed 40 minutes a day on Douyin.  
https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58625934

Therefore, knowing all these harmful consequences of TikTok,
and the danger represented by the access that the Chinese dictatorship has to the remote control of TikTok,
it is urgent to seriously question the massive adoption of this social network.
Bringing people to TikTok is increasing our dependence on the Chinese authorities,
in a more insidious way than Germany's dependence on Russian gas or the Chinese market.
TikTok is not cool.
It is a societal danger.

That said, boycotting TikTok individually will not be enough.
After all, TikTok affects more than just its users.
By skewing the attention of those users, TikTok is a threat to all of society,
and in particular to the prioritization of important issues and to collective decision-making.
Furthermore, auditing TikTok will not be enough.
Even if these audits are necessary to better understand what TikTok recommends,
they will tell us nothing about what TikTok will recommend in the future,
once it has successfully infiltrated democracies,
and that Xi Jinping will decide to exploit this infiltration to modify his remote control,
and make it massively amplify disinformation and hatred in democracies.

But then what to do. Should TikTok be banned, as Iran and India have done,
and as some members of the US Federal Communications Commission suggest,
even if it means making millions of users unhappy?
Or can we envisage a takeover of TikTok in Europe? 
or even a nationalization of the service offered by the social network?  
https://www.axios.com/2022/11/01/interview-fcc-commissioner-says-government-should-ban-tiktok

It seems to me that there is an urgent need to take strong decisions to protect democracies.
However, I insist on it again:
the problem of the security of social networks, 
especially against misinformation, harassment and hate,
will not be solved unless we first require 
a collaborative, transparent and auditable governance of the remote controls of these social networks,
which requires effective and secure tools for collaborative governance 
of collaborative governance of these remotes.

In short. What we need above all to secure our democracies,
is, it seems to me, to secure, develop and promote platforms like Tournesol.
And to achieve this, very concretely today,
we especially need much more attention, contributions and funding from Tournesol.
So, once again, I urge you to learn about our project,
to promote it to your friends and family and to your professional environment,
to provide video comparisons to feed our database
and to identify more quality videos,
to contribute to the open source development of our free code,
and to donate to the Tournesol Association,
or even to call for funds to consider the financing of a web finally governed
in a multilateral, collaborative and secure way.

I hope to have convinced you that the future of our societies depends on it.
